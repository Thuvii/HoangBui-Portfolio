    <h1>Project 4: Customer Segmentation using Clustering</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Introduce the Problem</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, the goal is to <strong>segment customers</strong> based on their purchasing behavior using clustering techniques.
            Businesses often have thousands of customers, but not all customers behave the same way.
            Some buy frequently, others rarely, and some spend much more money than others.
            Understanding these different groups (or <em>segments</em>) can help a business create <strong>targeted marketing strategies</strong>,
            improve customer retention, and increase overall revenue.
        </p>
        <p>The main questions I aim to answer are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Can we identify distinct customer groups based on their <strong>recency</strong>, <strong>frequency</strong>, and <strong>monetary value</strong>?</li>
            <li>What characterizes each group — for example, which cluster represents “loyal” or “high-value” customers?</li>
            <li>How can these insights help a business make data-driven marketing decisions?</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. What is Clustering and How Does it Work?</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Clustering</strong> is an <strong>unsupervised machine learning</strong> technique that automatically groups similar data points together based on their features.
            Unlike classification, clustering does not use labeled data — it simply finds patterns in the data itself.
        </p>
        <p>In this project, I used <strong>K-Means clustering</strong>, one of the most common algorithms. Here’s how it works:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The algorithm randomly selects <em>k</em> cluster centers (called centroids).</li>
            <li>Each data point is assigned to the nearest centroid based on distance (usually Euclidean distance).</li>
            <li>The centroids are updated by taking the mean of all points in each cluster.</li>
            <li>Steps 2–3 repeat until the centroids no longer change much.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The main parameter is <strong>k</strong>, the number of clusters. I used the <em>Elbow Method</em> and <em>Silhouette Score</em> to determine the optimal k.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>3. Introduce the Data</h2>
        <p>
            The dataset used is the
            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/online-retail-dataset" target="_blank">
                Online Retail II Dataset
            </a>
            from Kaggle. It contains transactions from a UK-based online retail store between 2009 and 2011.
        </p>
        <p>Each row represents an invoice item, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>InvoiceNo</strong>: invoice number</li>
            <li><strong>StockCode</strong>: product ID</li>
            <li><strong>Description</strong>: product name</li>
            <li><strong>Quantity</strong>: number of items purchased</li>
            <li><strong>InvoiceDate</strong>: date and time of the transaction</li>
            <li><strong>UnitPrice</strong>: price per item</li>
            <li><strong>CustomerID</strong>: unique identifier for each customer</li>
            <li><strong>Country</strong>: location of the customer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For clustering, I used three key features derived from RFM analysis:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Recency:</strong> Days since the customer’s last purchase (lower = more recent activity)</li>
            <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Number of unique purchases (higher = more active customer)</li>
            <li><strong>Monetary:</strong> Total amount spent (higher = more valuable customer)</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Data Understanding / Visualization</h2>
        <p>
            To better understand the data, I computed <strong>RFM values</strong> for each customer. I noticed:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some customers have very high monetary values, showing a strong skew — typical in retail data.</li>
            <li>A few customers had missing or invalid values (like negative quantities or zero totals), which were removed.</li>
            <li>Histograms showed that <strong>Recency</strong> and <strong>Monetary</strong> were right-skewed, so a <em>log transformation</em> was applied to normalize the data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Using scatter plots of <code>Recency</code> vs. <code>Monetary</code> and <code>Frequency</code> vs. <code>Monetary</code>, I observed:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some customers buy rarely but spend a lot.</li>
            <li>Others buy often but spend small amounts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This visualization helped confirm that clustering was a suitable approach, since there were natural differences in behavior.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Pre-processing the Data</h2>
        <p>The following preprocessing steps were performed:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Removed missing values and negative quantities</strong> — to ensure clean, valid transactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Aggregated by CustomerID</strong> — to compute RFM metrics per customer.</li>
            <li><strong>Log-transformed</strong> Recency, Frequency, and Monetary — to reduce skewness.</li>
            <li><strong>Standardized (scaled)</strong> the data using <code>StandardScaler</code> — since K-Means is distance-based and sensitive to variable scales.</li>
            <li><strong>Checked for NaNs</strong> again before modeling to avoid KMeans errors.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These steps ensured fair clustering where all features contributed equally.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Modeling (Clustering)</h2>
        <p>
            I applied <strong>K-Means clustering</strong> to the scaled RFM data.
            To find the best <em>k</em>, I used the <strong>Elbow Method</strong> and <strong>Silhouette Score</strong>.
            After testing different <em>k</em> values, I found that <strong>k = 4</strong> provided the best balance between simplicity and separation quality.

        <h2>7. Storytelling (Clustering Analysis)</h2>
        <p>The four clusters reveal distinct customer segments:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Cluster</th>

            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>Low Recency, High Frequency, High Monetary</td>
                <td><strong>Loyal high spenders</strong> — active, valuable customers who buy often.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>Moderate Recency and Frequency, High Monetary</td>
                <td><strong>Potential loyalists</strong> — good customers but less frequent buyers.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>Recent but low Frequency and Monetary</td>
                <td><strong>New customers</strong> — just started buying, may grow in value.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>High Recency, Low Frequency and Monetary</td>
                <td><strong>At-risk customers</strong> — haven’t purchased in a long time.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            From this, businesses can take action such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Offer <strong>exclusive rewards</strong> for Cluster 1 to maintain loyalty.</li>
            <li><strong>Re-engage</strong> Cluster 0 with targeted promotions.</li>
            <li>Send <strong>personalized recommendations</strong> to Cluster 2 to increase their engagement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Thus, clustering helped transform raw transaction data into actionable customer insights.

        <h2>8. Impact Section</h2>
        <p>
            The project’s potential <strong>social and ethical impact</strong> lies in how the business uses the data.
            While clustering can improve customer experience through personalized marketing, it can also raise <strong>privacy concerns</strong> if customer data is used without proper consent.
            Additionally, heavy reliance on segmentation could unintentionally exclude lower-spending customers from benefits, creating fairness issues.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hence, businesses should use clustering results responsibly, ensuring <strong>data transparency</strong> and <strong>ethical marketing practices</strong>.
